          I struggled with the listItem question in this part of homework. I either am able to list it in original function with console.log, but when calling it get undefined. Or call it and get first item. I tried getting the console log of listed items in function to be equal to a variable and set that variable equal to return but that doesn't seem to work. Not sure why the rest of list after first aren't returning.
